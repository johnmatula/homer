# Homer
Run a specified command when the Home button is clicked, optionally preventing the default action. Other than a quick icon in Sketch, this is a kludged-together tweak specifically targeting jailbroken devices running iOS 7 (iPhone 4 and related devices).

## To build
1. Install Theos on your Mac.
1. Clone the repo locally.
1. Run `make do`, which builds the package and attempts to install on your iOS device (if youâ€™ve [set the device IP address first](https://theos.dev/docs/commands)).
